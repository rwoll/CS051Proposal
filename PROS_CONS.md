# The Good, the Bad, and the Merge Conflict

### Pros

+ Increased knowledge of industry workflow for beginning computer science students.
+ Simplified TA grading workflow
+ Reduced amount of folder naming complications
+ Inline code commenting feedback in the style of industry standard code review
+ Promote the development of sustainable, version-controlled code
+ Possibility for more collaborative projects
+ Easy for TA to provide feedback on student code outside lab sessions or mentoring hours without having to post to Piazza
+ Will increase performance of the students in the later, more complex labs.
+ TAs are more accountable for their feedback because comments on code and grades are easily viewable by the grading team-- more quality feedback 
+ Professors will have a clearer picture at student coding progression throughout the semester 
+ Easily switch working between lab and personal computers
+ TAs won’t overwrite student submissions.
+ Easier ability to catch academic dishonesty because there’s a clear picture of the development process
+ Easy ability to revert to older versions of code -- no more overwriting test programs hours before they are due!
+ Low-risk refactoring and experimentation (e.g. 0 index vs. 1 index)
+ Existing GUI tools allow for the avoidance of intimidating command-line use.
+ Simplified process for students to get projects in and out of Eclipse (after 
  the initial setup)

### Cons

+ Steeper learning curve -- The addition of Git lingo and concepts can be
  confusing at first
+ The command line is scary (but can be avoided!)
+ Merge conflicts 
+ The first lab would require additional setup for the students
+ Configuration of remotes (for the first lab setup) could be confusing.
+ Git could distract from the core CS51 curriculumn if instructions surrounding
  its usage is unclear
